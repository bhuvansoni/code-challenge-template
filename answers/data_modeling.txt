Problem - Data Modeling
Approach and Reasoning:

1. Weather Data Table**:
   - We store each weather record with columns for station ID, date, max temperature, min temperature, and precipitation.
   - We ensure uniqueness by enforcing a composite `UNIQUE` constraint on `station_id` and `date`.
   - Missing values are represented by `NULL` or `NULL` equivalents (like `-9999` for weather readings that are missing).

2. Weather Statistics Table**:
   - We create a separate table to store the calculated yearly statistics for each station.
   - This avoids redundant calculations when querying for statistics and helps in optimizing performance.
   - The statistics include average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, and total accumulated precipitation for each year and station.

Queries used to create table - 
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    max_temp INT,       -- Maximum temperature in tenths of Celsius
    min_temp INT,       -- Minimum temperature in tenths of Celsius
    precipitation INT,  -- Precipitation in tenths of millimeters
    UNIQUE(station_id, date)
);

CREATE TABLE weather_stats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    year INT NOT NULL,
    avg_max_temp FLOAT,     -- Average maximum temperature in Celsius
    avg_min_temp FLOAT,     -- Average minimum temperature in Celsius
    total_precipitation FLOAT,  -- Total precipitation in centimeters
    UNIQUE(station_id, year)
);
